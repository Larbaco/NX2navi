// The deferred binds of a recording copy at a synchronous submission, and what keeps a second submission of the same
// copy, made by another guest thread while the first is replayed, from rewriting it (nvn_api_cmd.c
// nvn_submit_prepare, nvn_submit_done). Header only, so that tests/submit_clone_check.c checks it without a device.
//
// A deferred bind takes the handles the game's array holds at the submit call, and they are written into the recording
// copy (nvn_resolve_binds). With the replay on the submitting thread, a second thread that submitted the same copy
// while the first one replayed it, or copied it for a held continuation (vk_exec.c cont_new), rewrote the handles that
// replay was reading: textures and samplers of the next frame halfway through it. So each copy counts the submissions
// between their prepare and the end of their replay (busy): the first one resolves in place, as before; one that finds
// another in flight resolves a clone of its own, freed after its replay, as the asynchronous path does for a copy a
// queued submission still reads. A clone taken while the first thread still resolves in place may hold a mix of old and
// new handles in its binds' arrays only, and its own resolve then writes every deferred array again: it ends whole.
