// RivaTuner Statistics Server as the frame limiter (frame_rate.c frame_step_cap_ns): where RTSS is installed and running,
// the frame limit goes into RTSS's profile for this executable and, while RTSS is seen holding the game to it, the
// game's own pacer keeps only the 240-frame ceiling (rtss_decide.h rtss_pace_period), so there is one limiter.
// Anywhere else, or when any step fails, the game's own limiter works as it always did.
//
// RTSS's hooks library (RTSSHooks64.dll in the folder its installer records under
// HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Unwinder\RTSS, InstallDir) exports the profile calls, loaded here at run time:
// LoadProfile(name) reads a profile (the global one for a name without its own), Get/SetProfileProperty read and change
// the loaded copy, SaveProfile(name) writes it to Profiles\<name>.cfg, UpdateProfiles makes every hooked process
// read its profile again, EnumProfiles lists the profiles that exist (profile_exists says why it is not called),
// DeleteProfile removes one. "FramerateLimit" is the limit in frames per second (0: none); "FramerateLimitDenominator"
// divides it, so 59940 over 1000 limits to 59.94 (a monitor's measured rate). SaveProfile reports nothing: RTSS's
// Profiles folder sits under Program Files, which a process without administrator rights cannot write, and the save
// then fails silently. So every change is read back
// from the saved profile, and a limit that did not stick leaves the game's own limiter in charge for the session.
//
// RTSS runs when its shared memory "RTSSSharedMemoryV2" carries the signature 'RTSS'. The game's own limiter stands
// aside only once RTSS is seen to hold the game (rtss_decide.h rtss_decide): the memory's application list holds this
// process id with its Vulkan presents (RTSS hooks a process some seconds after it starts, its injection delay), RTSS
// has read the profile the game wrote, it measured a period of the game's frames lately, no movie plays and pictures
// go out. Until then, and again whenever one of these ends (RTSS quits, the window is minimised), the game's own limiter
// paces the frames. While RTSS limits, each new period RTSS measures for the game is checked against the limit: above
// 1.05 times it for three periods in a row, and the game takes the limiting back for the rest of the run.
//
// The calls run on a thread of their own, every half second, which also looks RTSS up (find_rtss), so a present never
// waits on the registry or profile files. On every orderly exit (rtss_limit_restore) the profile gets back what it held
// before the game changed it: the old limit, or no profile of its own when there was none; from then on no want reaches
// it and the game's own limiter paces the frames left. What it held is also kept in rtss-profile.txt next to the
// executable (rtss_decide.h RtssSaved), written before the run's first change of the profile and removed once the
// profile is back: an exit that skips the restore (a kill, a hang, the device-lost watchdog) leaves the line, and the
// next start puts the profile back from it before it changes anything (restore_left), unless the player changed the
// profile since. A crash and a fatal error leave it to that start too (rtss_limit_crash), with no call into RTSS's
// library from the failing process.
//
// NX2NAVI_RTSS=0 keeps RTSS out of it. Frame generation keeps it out too (RTSS counts every presented frame, the
// generated ones included), and so does a driver's low latency (vk_lowlat.c), which holds the frames where they start.
// While RTSS is kept out the thread does not load the hooks library and only reads RTSS's own settings for the game, to
// tell when they limit it a second time (watch); a later limit (frame generation or low latency switched off) loads it
// and hands RTSS the limit as usual, and NX2NAVI_RTSS=0 keeps the thread read-only for the run.
