// The stutter map (NX2NAVI_STUTTER_MAP=1): what a play session's hitches were, area by area, and which pipelines and
// shaders the draws met missing, so a long session says where the remaining stutters are and what the next pipeline
// list (tools/pipeline_list.py merge) and shader preparation must take in. Off by default; while it is off every hook
// returns at its first test.
//
// A hitch is a frame that stands out from the frames around it: its interval is over 2.5 times the median of the 32
// frames before it and at least 12 ms (or over 25 ms), and both of the next two frames are under two thirds of it
// (a frame over SM_HITCH_SURE_NS is one whatever follows). At 140 fps that is a frame over 17.5 ms followed by shorter
// ones. The look at the next two frames keeps a change of pace out: the game drawing its menus or a scene at a steady
// 60 or 30 fps after 140 is a slower rate, not a run of hitches, and the median takes the new rate within 16 frames.
// The decision waits two presents; the line and the counts carry what the frame itself waited for. Frames within
// SM_LOAD_NS of an area's load count apart, as the load's: an area load shows as a few long frames that are not a
// stutter in play. An area load is the game's (stutter_area) or the texture pool's (stutter_load: the pool makes an
// area's textures, vk_exec_draw.c pool_loading), which comes without the game's when it streams the next area in.
// Consecutive long frames are one episode, a hitch counted once with their summed time: a change of pace is a run of
// more than SM_EPISODE_MAX long frames none of which stands out from the ones after it, and an episode ends at its
// last frame that stood out once more than SM_EPISODE_MAX such frames follow that one. Three frames of 87, 91 and
// 96 ms after an area load (2026-11-13) each counted as a change of pace before, as each was followed by one as long.
//
// What a hitch went to comes from the frame-time summary's split (perf.c ft_frame: pipeline, translation, texture,
// fence, pacing, hand-off, replay, census, report, unattributed), with the draws that met a pipeline or a shader
// missing between the previous present and this one (stutter_miss, from the replay thread). Each hitch gets a
// "stutter:" line, at most SM_LINES_PER_S a second and SM_LINES_MAX in all; the counts go on past that. Every
// SM_REPORT_NS of play, when the window loses the focus in play (perf.c session_report) and at exit, "stutter map"
// lines rank the areas by their hitches and the pipelines by the time draws lost to them, each with whether this
// install had recorded it before (the pipeline list or an earlier run) and whether one of its shaders was translated
// in play rather than prepared.
//
// Threads: stutter_area runs on the game's loading threads, stutter_miss on the replay thread, stutter_ready on the
// pipeline workers (under vk_pipeline.c's P.lock; sm_lock is taken inside it and never takes it), stutter_frame and
// the periodic report on the present thread. The area table's play counts belong to the present thread; the rest is
// under sm_lock. A report copies the map under sm_lock and sorts and logs the copy without it.
